# Motion-Tracking-Liquid-Displacement-TouchDesigner
This TouchDesigner project explores liquid displacement as a dynamic motion-tracking system using a live camera feed. By integrating camera input with real-time CHOP and TOP networks, the visual reacts to movement by transforming tracked silhouettes into fluid-like distortions.
